# .NET-Core-2.0-Simple-TCP-Server
Very simple TCP Server created by using .net core 2.0

I am just exploring C# and .NET Core. It means this code may contain many errors or at least there should be a better way :)

The majority of the tcp part is copy-and-pasted from .NET Api Documentation(https://docs.microsoft.com/ko-kr/dotnet/api/?view=netcore-2.0).
